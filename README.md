# Hierarchical Beta Mixture Model

This is the implementation of a statistical technique called Mixture models using a Beta distribution to find a Meta-distribution composed by others via weighted sub-distributions.

In particular, we use the Beta distribution to handle proportions as its domain relies in [0, 1]. Basically, we want to look for a pseudo-joint distribution. The motivation of this project is to find the distribution of transition probabilities part of the dynamic system in obesity prevalence, i.e., answer the kind of questions of "what's the probability of a obese person of certain age and sex to be normal-weight, underweight or overweight during next period?"

Preliminary results were presented at ALIO-EURO 2022 conference. The detailed description of the project is public under [this proceeding document](http://dx.doi.org/10.48786/alioeuro.2022.13).

For an illustration of the project, the presentation I made is freely available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1094s6Y7ExIq4wqb-4iMAtmmN_ZKbSCWX/view).
